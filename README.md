**PROBLEM STATEMENT :**
 - Create a Streamlit application that allows users to access and analyze data from multiple YouTube channels. 
 - Extracting data using Youtube API and then Transforming it to a relational database like MySQL. For getting various info about youtube channels.

 **FEATURES:**
_**Data Collection**:_
  - Harvest data from YouTube channels and videos using the Google API Client.

**_Data Storage:**
  - Store the collected data in a MySQL database.

**Data Analysis**:
   -Perform various analytical queries on the data.

**Visualization:**
 - Visualize the data using Streamlit.

**User Interface:**
-  Interactive Streamlit interface for querying and viewing data.

**TECHNOLOGIES USED:**
    	Python(https://www.python.org/)
    	MySQL(https://www.mysql.com/)
    	YouTube Data API(https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3)
    	Streamlit(https://docs.streamlit.io/library/api-reference)
    	Pandas(https://pandas.pydata.org/)

**INSTALLATION VERSION:**
        Python version 3.12.2
        Streamlit  version 1.35.0
	Mysql version 8.0.36

**RUNNING OF INSTALLATION:**
To run this project, you need to install the following packages:

        pip install google-api-python-client
	pip install streamlit
	pip install mysql.connector python
	pip install streamlit

**TOOLS AND LIBRARIES USED:**

**STREAMLIT:**

-Streamlit library was used to create a user-friendly UI.
-It enables users to interact with the programme and carry out data retrieval and analysis operations.

**PYTHON:**

-Python is a high level programming language.
-Python is the primary language employed in this project for the development of the complete application, including data retrieval, processing, analysis, and visualisation.

**GOOGLE API CLIENT:**

-The googleapiclient library communicat with different Google APIs.
- Google API is used to retrieve channel data,video data and  comment data from Youtube.
 SQL (MySQL): 
-A relational database used as a data warehouse for storing migrated YouTube data.

**WORKFLOW**:

**COLLECTION OF DATA:**

  -Retreiving data from youtube channels using Youtube API key and gaining the information which we required from the channels.

**STORAGE OF DATA:**

   -Once the information is gained it all the store in MySql database.Migration of data  to a SQL database for efficient querying and analysis.
    Search and retrieval of data from the SQL database.Support for handling multiple YouTube channels and managing their data.

**STREAMLIT DASHBOARD:**
   -The above mentioned all informations are to be described in the Streamlit Dashboard and its functionalities to provide a user friendly interactions to visulaize the data.
